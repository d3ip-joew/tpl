# tpl

Simple templating from environment variables.

## Usage

Given the following sample file (sample.txt):

```
Hello {{ .Env.USER }}
```

```bash
$ tpl sample.txt
Hello saghul
```

The output is always stdout. This utility is means to be used as follows:

```bash
$ tpl nginx.conf.tpl > nginx.conf
```

## Template context

Templates use Golang [text/template](http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/).

You can access environment variables within a template in the `.Env` object.

There are some built-in functions as well: Masterminds/sprig v3

- countRune

    - reReplaceAll
    - reReplaceAllLiteral
    - reSplit
